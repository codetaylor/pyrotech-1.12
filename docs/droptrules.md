!!! note "Pyrotech in 1.14.4 and beyond!"
    Hi, I'm Codetaylor, the creator of Pyrotech and I would love to work on moving the mod to more recent versions of Minecraft. If you'd like to see Pyrotech move beyond 1.12.2, [click here to read more about my campaign to make that happen](https://bit.ly/2KaxA3Hd)!
    
Pyrotech uses Dropt to modify block drops.

Pyrotech uses a rule priority of `0`. If you want your rule to be considered before Pyrotech's rules, use a rule priority greater than `0`.

Rule groups can be individually disabled in `plugin.Dropt.cfg`.

Here is a list of the rules and what they do.
