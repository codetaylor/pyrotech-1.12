## Feature Request Guidelines

Feature requests, ideas, and suggestions are welcome.

Please follow these guidelines when submitting:

* Use an issue title that clearly and concisely describes your idea. *Do not* prefix your issue title with `[Suggestion]`, `[Idea]`, or `[Request]`. Tags for issues will be selected and applied by project members.
* Restrict to *one* request, idea, or suggestion per issue; if you have multiple ideas, create multiple issues. When ideas are separated into individual issues, it is much easier to organize, tag, discuss, and close those individual issues than it is a list of ideas in one issue. Additionally, it is easier for others to check if their idea has already been suggested before posting.
* Read through existing suggestions before posting. If your idea is similar to an existing idea, comment on the existing idea instead of making a new issue.
* *Do not* inquire about porting the mod to newer versions of Minecraft or backporting to older versions of Minecraft.

If your request, idea, or suggestion does not follow these guidelines, it will be tagged as such and may be immediately closed.

Project members reserve the right to decide what is and is not implemented.

## Backporting

No.

## Future Versions of Minecraft

Will the mod be developed for future versions of minecraft? *Probably*.

When? *Yes*.
